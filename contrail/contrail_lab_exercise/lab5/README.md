# Configuring InterVN routing
In this lab exercise, another virtual network, RED, will be created, and VMs and BMS will be attached to VM Red, then InterVN routing between VN Blue and RED will be configured.

Steps :
1. Access [contrail command dashboard](https://172.16.11.15:9091) 
2. Select project `Demo1`
3. Create VN Red with subnet 192.168.102.0/24
